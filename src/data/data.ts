      "Agricultural information encompasses ​diverse types of data​, from policy, technical and scientific textual documents, through visualizations of temporally and spatially explicit information, to scientific data and models to allow nowcasting and forecasting of agricultural outcomes. Many, if not all, of these types of data are regularly sought after and used by experts in agriculture and poverty reduction, in order to understand the current situation in a given geographical context, identify current and predicted trends, and define actions and policies to implement. However, much of that information is described and catalogued using natural language and ​ad­hoc semantics​, which limits the potential for unified search across different information systems, and makes the use and reuse of data for tasks such as impact assessment, extraction of trends or projections into the future extremely laborious and hardly replicable.",

    description:
      'The proposed setting–Development Science Framework (DSF), views each SDG as a source of highly correlated Big Data attributes and seeks to explore their interactions in a predictive, spatio-temporal context. For example, the relationships among SDGs 13, 14 & 15 on human livelihood, reflected by SDGs 1 through 7, are particularly intriguing and modelling their dynamics can provide answers to general questions in the form of What Works Across Countries and Sectors? The relationships among attributes describe the invariant conditions that epitomise the meaningfulness of the concept which DSF learns from available data. DSF adopts first principles approach, treating SDGs as sub-projects, driven by the well-documented relationship between knowledge & development in time and space. It focuses on trust, interdisciplinarity, authoritative data, knowledge transfer, resources, tools & techniques. Analogous to Eleanor Roosevelt’s view on where universal rights begin, it takes a bottom-up approach to the universal agenda 2030, seeking real knowledge on indicators from \\"...small places, close to home–so close and so small that they cannot be seen on\\" the World Bank SDG Atlas. Its main objectives are therefore to map and deliver knowledge about clusters of individual societies on that global map, their disparate neighborhoods, activities, achievements and influencing factors, based on indicators deriving from relevant and authoritative data from various sources, including grey literature and citizen science. Its implementation strategy is for three pilot DSF SDG monitoring nodes to be established in three African countries with known socio-economic heterogeneity, in order to provide a clear baseline for the project. To effectively support agenda 2030 at the country level, the project requires a guarantee that policy makers affecting each monitoring node, are in full agreement with Open Data Initiative (ODI) agenda.',

Infrastructure and guidance are still required to make it easier for researchers to use this type of citation and to receive or give credit for the object used in the research. Solving the problem of these reliquary citations is critical to enabling reproducible research. Moreover, enabling these complex reliquary citations will be important for researchers to be able to trace citation and usage of their work and report on its impact to funders.

We aim to shift the way neuroimaging research is performed and reported, with the development and implementation of technology that supports reproducibility at the levels of data management, analysis and utilisation for both within- and between-lab opportunities, including the use of widely distributed and/or large populations to address basic and clinical research questions. In short, the ReproNim vision is to help neuroimaging researchers: Find and Share data in a FAIR fashion (discover resources); Comprehensively describe their data and analysis workflows (describe research processes); and Manage their computational resource options (do analysis).",

    description:
      "Farmers have the capability as they have never had before to critically evaluate management practices using field-scale replicated strip trials. Farmers have gained this powerful capability because yield monitors on combines enable accurate measurement of yields. Networks of farmers have become increasingly common to exploit the potential of yield monitors to evaluate management practices at the field level. Networks of farmers have also become increasingly common because farmers understand the power of evaluating management practices across many fields. Collection of results from strip trials across many fields requires protocols for data stewardship, that is, for data reporting, sharing and archiving. All farmer networks have developed data stewardship protocols. The protocols, however, vary from network to network, and the protocols are not easily accessible to people outside the networks. Creation of a standardized set of protocols for data stewardship that are publicly available would promote the formation of new farmer networks. More importantly, the creation of standardized protocols, especially for confidentiality and sharing of data, would enable the combining of results from many networks into one secure database. A combined database would facilitate analyses across space and time that would provide much more useful and robust answers to many applied questions about crop production practices, which would increase profitability and decrease environmental pollution caused by food production.",

They can be used to give every data object (including collection objects) an identity that enables referring to the data resources and metadata and, additionally, to prove integrity, authenticity and other attributes. But this requires a PID to be uniquely associated with specific types of information, and those types and their association with PIDs must be well managed. Therefore it is useful to specify a framework for information types, to start agreeing on some essential types, and to define a process by which other types can be integrated. The framework provides generic facilities only, which can and must be employed by specific communities to support their needs. The focus of the working group therefore is on cross-community concerns.",

Moreover, the compliance of a data repository or data center providing datasets - for example with certification requirements - could serve as a useful proxy. Firstly, a concept of data fitness requires assessment of quality criteria to be included as well as the weighing of each of those criteria. The process should preferably lead to the development of a corresponding metric.

The desired outcome is a recommendation on guidelines for journals, authors, publishing staff, editors, peer-reviewers, standards, and machine readable infrastructure.",

      "Harmonised terminologies and schemas for FAIR data in materials science and related domains WG",
    description:
      "The focus of the WG is on increasing uptake of the FAIR Principles in materials research (in particular in connection with Interoperability and Reusability), supported by improved resources, in particular widely-agreed and FAIR terminologies, metadata and ontologies. While the main focus of the WG is in the material sciences, close interactions with cognate domains, in particular chemistry, are crucial in order to avoid conflicting approaches and also to utilise and integrate with already existing semantic artefacts and resources in these fields.",

      "RDA-OfR Creating a Multi-omics Metadata Schema Standard Reporting Matrix WG",
    description:
      "The WG will research and consult existing work in the area by undertaking an in-depth landscape review to identify current Omics domain data standards (common data formats, controlled vocabularies and ontologies, metadata reporting guidelines, and identifier schemas) outlined by community accepted data management and sharing best practices within and across the different Omics domains. This work will leverage and build upon existing resource records at FAIRsharing (an RDA WG and a curated, informative and educational resource on data and metadata standards, inter-related to databases and data policies) in evaluating existing community Omics standard records in contribution to an iterative and open Omics Domain Collection at FAIRsharing as part of the landscape review recommendation output. Leveraging FAIRsharing educational materials to help guide WG curation activities, the group will collect standalone Omics domain community standards and reporting guidelines for informed downstream crosswalk activities. The Omics landscape review and analysis collection serves to benefit and encourage continuous (machine-actionable) community level standard curation beyond the lifecycle of the WG for existing and future research community stakeholder groups focused on data standards in life sciences.",

    title: "Empirical Humanities Metadata Working Group",
    description:
      "The empirical humanities include history, folklore, cultural anthropology and other fields in which researchers collect primary data of different types that can be used for cultural analysis. Today, these researchers often need to collaborate to understand phenomena that operate across geographic regions, scale and communities of people. But established research practices and infrastructures in the empirical humanities do not support this. The Empirical Humanities Metadata WG (EHM) will conduct research, develop a statement of best practices and release an adoptable product centered on what needs to be in place (standards, protocols, policies, cultural expectations) to make ethnographic and historical data archivable, discoverable and shareable.",
